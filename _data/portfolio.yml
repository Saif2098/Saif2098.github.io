  # url: "/portfolio/1-winerf"
  excerpt: "Developed a novel wireless differentiable rendering technique using 'wedge rays,' inspired by Mip-NeRF 360, to accurately model 2D Angle of Arrival (AoA) from a Uniform Linear Array. This technique was architected into a physics-inspired deep generative model using the Instant-NGP framework in PyTorch, learning a continuous representation of the wireless propagation field. The model can predict location-specific multipath characteristics, enabling proactive link optimization for mission-critical applications like AR/VR and robotics."

  # url: "/portfolio/2-rfid-vitals"
  excerpt: "A low-cost, non-invasive system for monitoring human vital signs using phase changes in backscattered signals from commercial UHF RFID tags. An LSTM model is used to estimate respiratory patterns from movement data."

- title: "Soil Moisture Sensing using Radio Frequency Signals"
  excerpt: "Employed a USRP software-defined radio to transmit OFDM WiFi signals and measure RSSI and Return Loss for soil samples, estimating water moisture percentage using Topp's Equation."

- title: "Social Media Data Analysis with BERT"
  excerpt: "Designed a public perception and sentiment analysis pipeline for social media data related to urban issues. A fine-tuned BERT transformer model was used for topic modeling and sentiment classification of data scraped from Twitter."

- title: "Raft-Based Key-Value Storage System"
  excerpt: "Designed and implemented a scalable, fault-tolerant key-value storage system in Go for a Distributed Systems course, utilizing the Raft consensus protocol to manage state across servers."
