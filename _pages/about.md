I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Elahe Soltanaghai](https://elahe.web.illinois.edu/#). My research interests revolve around the intersection of wireless systems and artificial intelligence, particularly in building novel networks capable of both sensing and communication. I leverage signal processing and machine learning techniques to solve challenging problems in wireless systems.

I completed my BS in Electrical Engineering with high distinction from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) in 2022. Prior to my Ph.D., I gained over a year of experience as a Research Assistant in the Smart Data Systems and Applications Laboratory at LUMS, where I worked on projects related to wireless sensing and machine learning.
